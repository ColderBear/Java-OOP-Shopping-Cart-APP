This is a final project for course SE450 - Object-Oriented Software Development, it is a console based shopping cart written in Java

This project showcased my proficiency in object-oriented programming, file input/output operations and serialization, as well as design patterns. 
Additionally, it has validated my capability to construct complex software systems, emphasizing the creation of code that is efficient, scalable, and easily maintainable.

Below is an in depth view of the features and technical skills applied in this project:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Designed and implemented a comprehensive shopping cart system using Java.
- Applied OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to create a structured and scalable codebase.
- Developed various classes like Product, ClothingProduct, ElectronicsProduct, and managed relationships between them to represent different product types effectively.

File I/O and Serialization
- Implemented file input/output operations for user authentication using the AuthenticationService class.
- Managed user data storage and retrieval, showcasing proficiency in handling file-based data persistence.
- Employed Java serialization techniques for maintaining the state of User objects, enhancing the robustness and efficiency of the user authentication process.

Factory Design Pattern
- Utilized the Factory Design Pattern in the creation of product instances through the ProductFactory class.
- Demonstrated expertise in design patterns to support flexible and maintainable code, allowing for easy extension and modification of product types.

Data Handling and Object Modeling
- Developed PaymentDetails class in Java to handle payment data, demonstrating skills in data encapsulation and object modeling.
- Managed sensitive data such as credit card information, ensuring data integrity and privacy.

Logic Implementation and Process Simulation
- Implemented payment processing logic in the PaymentProcessor class.
- Simulated payment validation based on card number criteria, showcasing ability to translate business rules into efficient code.

Logging and File Management
- Created AppLogger class for application logging, indicating proficiency in logging and file handling in Java.
- Configured loggers and file handlers for effective tracking and debugging of application activities.
